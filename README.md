## üìù About

**Quikkeys Backend** is designed to power the backend services of the **Quikkeys** application, which is a typing speed test platform that helps users improve their typing skills. This backend provides an API that interacts with the **Gemini API** to generate dynamic content based on different difficulty levels. It allows the frontend to fetch AI-generated paragraphs for users to type, calculate their typing speed (WPM), accuracy, and track errors.
